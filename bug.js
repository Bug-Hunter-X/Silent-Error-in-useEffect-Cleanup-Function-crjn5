This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error is often swallowed, making debugging difficult.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => { ... });

  return () => {
    // This is where the error might occur
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Throws an error if subscription is already unsubscribed
  };
}, []);
```
